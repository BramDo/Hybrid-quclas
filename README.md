This is the **hybrid quantum–classical**. You run a quantum circuit (unitary gates), **measure** to get classical features, and feed those into a classical MLP (your nonlinearity lives here). Physically that’s fine: the quantum part stays linear/CPTP; the nonlinearity is purely classical. It’s not a “nonlinear homeomorphism of the Bloch sphere,” though—it’s a pipeline from a quantum state to a **classical** output, typically many-to-one and not invertible.

A quick way to picture it

1. Prepare a state $\rho$ (say a qubit on the Bloch sphere).
2. Apply a parameterized unitary $U(\theta)$: $\rho' = U(\theta)\rho U(\theta)^\dagger$.
3. Measure a set of observables $O_1,\dots,O_m$ to get features

$$
f_i(\rho')=\mathrm{Tr}(\rho' O_i).
$$

This is **linear in $\rho'$**.
4\) Feed $f=(f_1,\dots,f_m)$ to an MLP: $y=\mathrm{MLP}(f)$.
All the nonlinearity is in the classical $\mathrm{MLP}(\cdot)$. If you close the loop and let the MLP pick the next quantum gates (feedback/adaptive control), the **conditional** update is nonlinear/stochastic (because of measurement), but the **average** map on quantum states remains CP and linear—no physics is violated.
